                GazaSkyGeeks has always been the talk of some of my close friends and colleagues on how much it helped them learn and grow in their fields, and I found myself interested on how what they have to offer that differs from all the other programming courses, but I saw how much support and care that was always provided to anyone willing to learn, and I felt that I wanted to experience that and improve myself to be a better engineer and explore new possibilities. I have always had a lot of interest in Web Development, from both the frontend to the backend, but have never found the right opportunity or support to fully start my journey in web development, until now hopefully with GazaSkyGeeks. I hope to be a part of such an amazing program with their excellent mentors and supporters.
